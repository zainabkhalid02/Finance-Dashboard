## Problem Statement

Objective: The goal of this project is to develop a Finance Dashboard to track key financial metrics, including income, expenses, and savings, over a given period (2021â€“2024). The dashboard provides valuable insights into how efficiently finances are managed by displaying the breakdown of expenses, savings, and overall financial health in a single view.

Context: Effective financial management is essential for individuals and organizations to make informed decisions. A well-structured financial dashboard allows users to visualize their financial standing over time, helping them identify key areas of overspending and maximize savings. This tool not only helps in monitoring past trends but also in making future financial projections.

Problem: Users often face challenges in keeping track of their income, expenses, and savings across multiple channels (e.g., bills, investments, fixed deposits). Lack of financial awareness can result in poor decision-making, leading to unsatisfactory savings and unnecessary expenses. Without an effective way to monitor these components, it becomes difficult to ensure financial stability and growth.

# Solution

The Finance Dashboard offers a comprehensive solution by:

        - Tracking total income, expenses, and savings with monthly percentage changes.
        - Breaking down expenses and savings into key components for better visibility.
        - Comparing year-over-year financial performance to identify growth or stagnation areas.
        - Visualizing expense trends over time to observe peak periods and optimize budgeting.

# Key features

        - Income Overview: Displays total income with the current month's percentage change.
        - Expense Breakdown: Highlights the major expense categories such as rent, groceries, bills, EMIs, etc.
        - Savings Composition: Visualizes the savings distribution across different financial instruments like liquid cash, mutual funds, and fixed deposits.
        - Yearly Comparison: Provides a year-over-year comparison of income, expenses, and savings to track financial growth.
        - Monthly Trends: The dashboard visualizes trends in income and expenses over time, helping users understand their financial patterns.
        - Interactivity: Filters allow users to focus on specific years or months, enabling detailed insights into particular periods.

# Data Sources & Tools

Data Sources: Financial data collected for the years 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 (hypothetical data).

Tools Used:
- Power BI: Used for creating the dashboard and visualizations.
- Excel: Used for data cleaning and preparation.
- DAX: For advanced calculations and metrics in Power BI.

# Insights

A single page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard:

### [1] Total Income = 3M

   Monthly Change in Income from Dec 20 to Jul 21 = 103%


    There is a significant increase in income this month, with a 103% monthly change.
           
### [2] Total Expenses = 1M

Monthly change in expense = 0%
  
    There has been no noticeable change in expenses for the current month. 
  
  ### [3] Total Savings = 2M 
  
    Percentage of Savings = 64%
    Monthly Change in Savings = 0%
    Expense vs Saving = 140%

Savings amount to 64% of the total income, and there is no significant change in savings this month. The expense vs. saving ratio is quite high, at 140%.

 ### [4] Expenses by Component
 
    House Rent
    Groceries & Bills
    EMIs
    Health
    Leisure
    Shopping
    Travel

The breakdown highlights that House Rent and Groceries & Bills are likely to be the largest expense categories. These categories will have a significant impact on overall expenses.

 ### [5] Savings by Component

The savings are diversified across the following components:

    Liquid Cash (largest portion)
    Mutual Funds
    Emergency Fund
    Fixed Deposit

A majority of the savings are held in Liquid Cash, followed by contributions to Mutual Funds and Emergency Fund. The breakdown helps assess where most savings are being kept.

 ### [6] Yearly Financial Comparison (2021 vs. 2022)

    2021:

    Expense = $303,333.00
    Income = $771,000.00
    Savings = $544,400.00

    2022:

    Expense = $364,318.00
    Income = $896,000.00
    Savings = $610,900.00

There is an increase in both income and savings in 2022 compared to 2021. The savings distribution remains heavily weighted toward Liquid Cash, but other components like Mutual Funds and Emergency Fund show steady growth.
